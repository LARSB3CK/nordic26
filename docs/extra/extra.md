## MQTT 

Frosti was interested in exploring the MQTT protocol. Árni set up a MQTT server for testing. 

Server information: 

```
host: wss://mqtt.kotra.is
port: 443
path: /mqtt
```

For initial testing, [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/) can be used. 

Contact us for user and password information.

This server will go offline shortly after the bootcamp, for your own testing you can use [test.mosquitto.org](https://test.mosquitto.org/)
