## About the workshop

This workshop was mostly in Karen´s hands. She began by teaching others how to prepaire files and use the embroidery machine. Later on the participants assisted others. This was a flowing workshop throughout the whole bootcamp. 

Last year we had the Icelandic bootcamp in Húsavík and we also had an embroidery workshop there. Anna Reneau and Ólöf covered some of the basics there. See [link here](https://fab-lab-island.github.io/fli-bootcamp-2025/verkefnavinna/Saumavel/). Some of the documentation here below is based on information from this site.

## The embroidery machine
