# Silkscreen printing

## MiScreen A4

In this workshop the [MiScreen a4](https://www.risoprinter.de/en/products/screen-printing/riso-miscreen-a4) machine was used to create the silkscreen.


## Workflow

!!!success "Resolution"

    The resolution of the image to be used has to be set to 203 DPI when using the MiScreen A4 machine. The file format to be used can for example be .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp and .pdf.

!!!Tip "Dithering or not"

    When an image is not dithered the print will give you a simple, flat surface. When you use some type of dithering you get different textures, f.ex. like the texture of a newsprint paper. If the image is in grayscale and you want the shading to appear on the print, you have to dither the image.

### Step 1

!!!note "Changing the resolution and using grayscale"

    The process can differ depending on which program you use to process the images. This is an example:

    * Find an image that you want to use

    * Upload it into Inkscape.

    * Click on the image to select it.

    * Right-click on the screen and choose **Document properties**.

    * Click on **Resize to content**.

    * Choose **File** and then **Export**.

    * Choose the .png format.

    * Choose the folder you want to export the image to.
    
    * Change the DPI to 203 and finally you click on **Export**.
